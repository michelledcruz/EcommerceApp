# E-commerce App
Overview
This project is a simple E-commerce App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6). The app allows users to browse products, add and remove items from their shopping cart, and manage their cart using local storage. It uses a free API to fetch e-commerce products and implements core features like a dynamic shopping cart system.

# Features
Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Product Listing: Fetches and displays a list of products from a free e-commerce products API.

# Shopping Cart:
Users can add products to the cart.
Users can remove products from the cart.
Cart totals (quantity and price) update dynamically.
Local Storage: The cart state (products, quantities, and total price) is saved in the browser’s local storage so that the user’s cart persists even after the page is refreshed.
Dynamic Product Cards: Product cards are dynamically generated from API data.
User Feedback: Alerts or messages are displayed when products are added or removed from the cart.


# Technologies Used

CSS: For styling the app, ensuring responsiveness, and enhancing user experience.
JavaScript (ES6): For dynamic interaction, fetching API data, and implementing features like adding/removing products from the shopping cart.
Promises and Async/Await: For fetching data from the API.
